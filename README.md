For HW02A, I created a piece inspired by Kazimir Malevich’s geometric abstraction, focusing on simplicity and precision. The original work features basic shapes such as rectangles and triangles, which I modified by adding rotation to better capture the dynamic nature of Malevich’s compositions. The shapes are aligned and rotated with attention to balance, and I ensured the artwork was responsive to different screen sizes by using windowWidth and windowHeight for the canvas dimensions. This update allows the piece to adapt to various devices while maintaining its minimalistic style.
